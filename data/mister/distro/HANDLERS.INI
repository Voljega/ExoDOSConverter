/// Handlers figure out what to do with what was loaded onto the system.
/// TDL comes with common file handlers, and the utilities to make them work.
/// You can add additional handlers to this file, up to a maximum of 255.
///
/// Handlers come in two types:
///   extraction: The file is an archive that needs extracting (zip, arc, etc.)
///    execution: The file can be executed (exe, com, bat, bas, pcx, txt, etc.)
///
/// Extraction handlers *extract* archives into cache directories.
///  Execution handlers *execute* whatever is found in a cache directory.
/// Usually this means programs, but you can "execute" any file based on its
/// extension.  For example, you can "execute" a text file with an extension
/// of .TXT by using a text file viewer such as LIST.COM. If the same
/// handler should handle multiple extensions (for example, if you want to
/// use LIST to view both TXT and DOC files), you can specify this by
/// separating them with semicolons, just like a PATH statement.
///
/// Launcher templates use the following variables in the launcher= line:
///
/// Execution:
///   %d = directory file is located in
///   %s = file to execute (ie. file.ext)
///        Current directory will be switched to %d
///   %f = file to execute, fully-qualified (ie. c:\dir\file.ext)
///        Current dir will be the directory the helper program resides in.
///
/// Because %s and %f are both source variables, you cannot use %s and %f in
/// the same launcher= line.  (If you don't understand this, use %s for
/// everything unless your launcher utility is a batch file.)
///
/// Extraction:
///   %s = source archive, fully-qualified
///   %d = destination for extracted files
///
