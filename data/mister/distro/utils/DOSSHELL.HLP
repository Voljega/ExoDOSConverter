Copy and Move Messages

Following are several specific MS-DOS Shell messages you may receive when moving and copying files and advice about how to handle them.

Invalid Path
------------
Make sure that you specified the correct path for the file or directory (including the correct drive letter). The path is the location of the file or directory in the directory tree. The entire path must not be longer than 66 characters. For more information about paths, see "MS-DOS Basics," in the User's Guide.

File or Drive Does Not Exist
----------------------------
Check to be sure the drive, path, and filename are correct. Use the file list to make sure the file is on the disk in the specified drive. Try using the Refresh command on the View menu to update the file list.

You Have More than One File Selected
------------------------------------
When you have more than one file selected that you want to copy or move, you must specify a destination directory -- not a file. Make sure you specified an existing directory and that its path is correct.

Access Denied
-------------
You may have tried using a file that you do not have access rights to. Check with your system administrator.@@

File List Messages

Following are several specific MS-DOS Shell messages you may receive and advice about how to handle them.

The File Doesn't Exist
----------------------
Make sure you specified the correct path and filename.

Access Denied or Invalid Path
-----------------------------
You may have tried one of the following:

   * Specifying an incorrect path. Make sure that you    
     specified the correct path for the file or directory
     (including the correct drive letter). The path is the
     location of the file or directory in the directory
     tree.

   * Renaming a file or directory to one that already exists
     in the same directory.

   * Within a directory, creating a new directory with the
     same name as a directory that already exists.

   * Deleting a directory that contains files. First you
     must delete or move the files.

   * Deleting a write-protected or read-only file. Try
     changing the file's attributes by using the Change
     Attributes command on the File menu.

   * Trying to perform operations on a write-protected disk.
     Remove the write-protection from the disk.

   * Using a file that you do not have access rights to.
     Check with your system administrator.

   * Creating a directory with a path that's too long.
     MS-DOS recognizes paths up to 66 characters (including
     the drive and colon [:]). Try specifying a shorter path
     for the directory.

For more information about paths, see "MS-DOS Basics" in the User's Guide.

That is the Wrong Floppy Disk
-----------------------------
Be sure you inserted the correct disk in the drive. When you insert the correct disk, MS-DOS Shell will continue with the operation.

That Drive Doesn't Exist
------------------------
Make sure you specified the correct drive letter. If you are using a network, make sure you are connected to it. Try using the Refresh command on the View menu to reread the drives.

Drive Not Ready
---------------
Check the drive to be sure of the following:

  * A disk is in the drive.

  * The drive door is closed.

  * The disk is properly inserted in the drive.

  * The disk is formatted.

Unrecognized Disk Error
-----------------------
If you're using a floppy disk, check to be sure that you've inserted the correct disk in the drive, that it is inserted properly, and that the drive door is closed.

Check to see that the disk and the drive are compatible. For example, you may be putting a high-density disk into a drive that only accepts low-density disks.

The disk may contain bad sectors. You can use the CHKDSK command at the command prompt to see if there are bad sectors on the disk.

Error Reading File
------------------
Make sure the file exists on the specified drive.

Error Writing to the Destination File
-------------------------------------
Make sure you inserted the correct disk in the drive. Or, it could be that the disk is damaged.

The File is in Use by Someone Else
----------------------------------
You tried to use a file on a network that someone else is using. To use the file, you must wait until it is available.

Take the Write-Protection off the Disk
---------------------------------------
The disk you are trying to use may have write-protection. This prevents data from being written to the disk. Remove the write-protection, or use a different disk without write-protection.

Error creating a temporary file on a drive
------------------------------------------
MS-DOS Shell cannot find the TEMP or TMP variable and you have tried to start a program from a write-protected disk. Temporary files cannot be created. You can either remove the write-protection from the disk, or set the TEMP or TMP variable in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

For more information about setting these variables, see
   "Setting the TEMP or TMP Variable"~I167~

Unrecognized Error
------------------
Retry the operation. If you still get a message, quit MS-DOS Shell and start it again, and then retry the procedure.

!I167!@
Setting the TEMP or TMP Variable

In the process of starting and quitting programs and MS-DOS Shell, temporary batch files are created and stored in a directory specified in the TEMP or TMP variables in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

You may have to reset the TEMP or TMP variable if:

  * The disk you want to restore deleted files from is full.
    The temporary files may overwrite deleted files you want
    to restore.

  * You started MS-DOS Shell from a write-protected disk.
    You will not be able to start the program.

When you start a program, MS-DOS Shell first looks for the directory specified in the TEMP variable and then in the TMP variable. If it can't find the directories, MS-DOS Shell will use the directory and drive where the running MS-DOS Shell is stored. If MS-DOS Shell can't create the temporary batch file in any of these directories, it displays the message "Error creating a temporary file to a drive."

The problem may be that you are running MS-DOS Shell from a write-protected disk.

You can try the following:

  * Remove the write-protection from the disks.

  * Set the TEMP or TMP variable to a directory on a
    disk that isn't write-protected.

NOTE: It's best to set the variable to a directory on the RAM drive. If the RAM drive doesn't have enough memory, specify a different directory.


To set the TEMP and TMP variables:

1. Quit MS-DOS Shell.

2. Choose or create a directory for the temporary files -- 
   for example, c:\temp; or if d: is your RAM drive, you
   could specify d:\. 

3. At the MS-DOS command prompt, use the set command to set
   each variable.

   To set this variable    Type
   --------------------    ----
   TEMP                    set TEMP=drive:\directory
   TMP                     set TMP=drive:\directory

   Specify the directory that you chose or created in Step
   2.

   NOTE: The TEMP and TMP variable can specify the same 
   or a different directory.

   NOTE: It's recommended that you set both variables 
   now so that no matter which program you will be using,
   the variable it uses will be set correctly.

4. Press ENTER.

5. Start MS-DOS Shell.@@

NOTE: A program item is not the program file itself. If you add a program item, you add only the program list's startup instructions for that program. The program itself remains in its directory on your hard drive.

To add a program item:

1. Open the group you want to add a new item to.
2. From the File menu, choose New.
   The New Program Object dialog box appears.
3. Select the Program Item option button and choose the 
   OK button.
   The Add Program dialog box appears.
4. Type a name for the program item (up to 23 characters).
5. In the Commands box, type the name of the program file
   that runs the program, along with any additional switches
   or parameters.
6. If you want, specify a startup directory, application
   shortcut key, password, or advanced properties for this
   item.
7. Choose the OK button.


To specify a shortcut key combination in the Application Shortcut Key box:

1. Select the Application Shortcut Key box.
2. Press and hold down one of the following keys: SHIFT,
   CTRL, or ALT, and then type a letter. 
   MS-DOS Shell displays the keys you pressed. If [none]
   appears in the text box, the shortcut key combination you
   entered is unavailable. Try another combination.

For example, if you want to use SHIFT+W to move to Microsoft Word, you would press SHIFT and then type w. MS-DOS Shell would display SHIFT+W in the text box and next to the program title in the Active Task List.

NOTE: Some key combinations are not available. Do not use the following key combinations:

CTRL+C
CTRL+M
CTRL+I
CTRL+H
CTRL+[
CTRL+5 (on the keypad)
SHIFT+CTRL+M
SHIFT+CTRL+I

Associating Files with a Program

Any file in the file list can be linked with a program so that opening the file automatically starts the program. Files are associated by their filename extensions. For example, you could link files that have the .TXT extension with MS-DOS Editor so that when you open a .TXT file, MS-DOS Editor automatically starts and opens that file.

You can also associate files without extensions to a program file. Note that every file without an extension will be associated with the selected program file.

To associate a file with a program:

1. Select the program file that you want to associate
   files with.
2. From the File menu, choose Associate.
   The Associate File dialog box appears.
3. Type the extensions of the files that you want to
   associate with the program, separating each
   extension with a space. To associate all files without
   an extension with a program file, type a period instead
   of an extension.
4. Choose the OK button.

Or

1. Select a file that has the extension you want.
2. From the File menu, choose Associate.
   The Associate File dialog box appears.
3. Type the path and program filename of the program you
   want to associate with that extension.
4. Choose the OK button.

NOTE: When associating multiple extensions, you can type up to 79 characters in the dialog box. However, you can only associate an extension with one program at a time. For example, you can't associate the extension .TXT with two different text-editing programs at the same time.

Printing Files

You can print files in MS-DOS Shell only from the file list and only if you have run print.exe at the command prompt. Before starting MS-DOS Shell, if you have already not started print.exe, you need to type the following at the command prompt:
       print

If you are in MS-DOS Shell and want to use the Print command, but have not already typed print at the command prompt, you need to quit MS-DOS Shell, type print, and then restart MS-DOS Shell.

To print in MS-DOS Shell:

1. From the file list, select one or more files.
2. From the File menu, choose Print.
   MS-DOS adds the files to the print queue.

NOTE: If the printer queue is full, MS-DOS Shell displays a dialog box for each file which was not printed. You can try printing the file again, skip printing the file and continue printing the rest of the files, or cancel printing the unprinted files.

NOTE: If you will be printing from MS-DOS Shell often, you can avoid typing the print command each time you use MS-DOS Shell by adding the print command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. 
If your AUTOEXEC.BAT file contains a dosshell command, be sure the print command precedes it. For more information about the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, see "Configuring Your System," in the User's Guide.

Restoring Deleted Files

Once you delete a file, you may be able to recover it. You can recover deleted files with certainty only if no other files have been created or changed on the disk.

CAUTION: Avoid running or quitting any programs or using any commands other those specified in this procedure until you restore the deleted file or files.

NOTE: If the disk you deleted files from is full, or if the TMP or TEMP variable in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file is set to the RAM drive, you may have trouble recovering deleted files. In the process of quitting programs and MS-DOS Shell, temporary files are created and stored in the directory specified in the TMP or TEMP variable. These temporary files may overwrite deleted files that you want to restore.

For more information about setting these variables, see
   "Setting the TEMP or TMP Variable"~I167~

There are several ways to restore files that you deleted. The following chart is to help you figure out the safest way to recover your files depending on importance of the files and the amount of disk space you have.

Welcome to MS-DOS Shell

MS-DOS Shell helps you see the organization of your files and programs at a glance.

  * Organize Files Graphically
    You can easily see where your files are located and
    see information about them.

  * Organize Programs Graphically
    You can organize programs into groups that make the
    programs easier to find and use.

  * Work with Files and Programs Graphically
    Instead of typing commands and parameters at the command
    prompt, you can choose commands from menus and specify
    options in dialog boxes.


When you first start MS-DOS Shell, you see a window with a list of the files on the current drive and a list of programs available to you. For more information about these lists, see
   " File List and Program List "~$114~

The parts of the MS-DOS Shell window include the following:

  * The title bar displays the name MS-DOS Shell at
    the top of your screen.

  * The menu bar lists the names of the available
    menus. When you select a menu, it displays a list
    of commands you can choose from.

  * Drive letters indicate which drives are currently
    available.

  * The window title displays the name of the current
    directory, group name, the Directory Tree, or the
    Active Task List.

  * The selection cursor shows what is selected in the
    list.

  * Scroll bars let you move part of a list into view
    when the whole list isn't visible at once.

  * The status bar displays messages and the current 
    time at the bottom of the screen.

You can choose from a variety of color combinations and screen modes for displaying MS-DOS Shell windows.

Scroll Bars

Some areas of the MS-DOS Shell window and dialog boxes contain scroll bars you can use to view text that requires more than the available space.

To scroll           Do this
---------           -------
Line by line        Click one of the scroll arrows.
                    Or, press the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW
                    key.

Continuously        Point to one of the scroll arrows
                    and hold down the mouse button
                    until the information you want
                    comes into view. Or, hold down
                    the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW key.

Quickly             Drag the scroll box up or down the
                    scroll bar to the position you
                    want. The section of the text or
                    list that comes into view depends
                    on the position of the scroll box.
                    For example, if you move the scroll
                    box halfway down the scroll bar,
                    the text halfway through a file
                    or list appears. You can also press the
                    PAGE DOWN or PAGE UP key.

Menus and Commands

Commands represent actions that you can tell MS-DOS Shell to carry out. MS-DOS Shell lists commands in menus. The menus vary depending on whether the selected MS-DOS Shell window  is displaying directories and files or groups and program items.

Selecting Menus
---------------
Selecting the menu is the first step in choosing a command. You can also select a menu to:

  * See its commands.

  * Get Help on the selected menu by pressing the F1 key.

When you want to close a menu without choosing a command, press ESC.

Choosing Commands
-----------------
Some commands perform tasks directly; others require more information. No matter which menu or command you want to use, you follow the same procedure: first select the menu and then choose the command.

Some command names have symbols and letters next to them and sometimes command names are dimmed.

When you see this    It means
-----------------    --------
Dimmed command       The command is not available at
                     this time. You might need to select
                     something before you can use the
                     command, or it might not be avail-
                     able for the task you are currently
                     performing.

Mark                 The command is active. Used for
                     a command that turns a feature either
                     on or off.

                     choose the command without first
                     displaying the menu.

Ellipsis (...)       A dialog box will appear when the
                     command is chosen, requesting
                     information needed to carry out the
                     command.

                     You can use the scroll bars to see
                     choices that aren't visible.

Option button        Select one from the group of small
                     round buttons. You can only select
                     one option at a time. The selected
                     option button contains a dot.

Text box             Type text in a box with a cursor in it.

After you supply the information, you choose the OK button to carry out the command.

To close a dialog box without carrying out the command:
 - Press ESC or choose the Cancel button.

You can also get Help on the dialog box by choosing the Help button.

File List and Program List

MS-DOS Shell provides two basic kinds of lists:

  * A list of directories and files

  * A list of program items and groups

MS-DOS Shell also offers you several ways to view these lists by using commands on the View menu, as follows:

To view                  Choose

File List Overview

The file list provides a convenient way to display and work with your disk drives, directories, and files. The file list displays a list of directories (called the Directory Tree) for a selected disk drive, and a list of files for a selected directory. Select a different disk drive to view its directory tree; select a different directory to view its files.

The menus at the top of the file list window contain commands you use when working with disks, directories, and files. You can use the file list to move, copy, delete, open, print, rename, change the attributes of, and view the contents of files. You can also create, delete, and rename directories. The command prompt is available from the file list as well.

Disk Drives

When you start MS-DOS Shell, the file list displays the directories and files on the disk that contains the command files for MS-DOS Shell. To work with other directories and files on another drive, you need to select the drive letter. If there are several directories on the new drive, MS-DOS Shell displays a "Reading Disk Information" message.

Directories

In the file list, you display directories to work with the files they contain.

Selecting Directories
---------------------
The current directory is the selected directory in the Directory Tree. You can select only one directory at a time in each Directory Tree window.

Expanding Directories
---------------------
When you start MS-DOS Shell, the Directory Tree displays only the first level of directories on the current drive.

A plus sign (+) to the left of a directory name indicates that one or more subdirectories exists for that directory. If you select a directory icon that includes a plus sign, MS-DOS Shell displays its subdirectories. This is called "expanding" the directory. When you expand a directory, the plus sign changes to a minus sign (-).

You can also use the commands on the Tree menu to control the amount of directory information displayed. You can expand an entire branch (all subdirectories in the selected directory), a single level of the branch, or all directories in the tree.

Collapsing Directories
----------------------
You can "collapse" the directory to hide any currently displayed subdirectories. The minus sign (-) changes to a plus sign (+). When you start MS-DOS Shell, it displays the directories in the root directory.

File Selection

Before you can work with a file in the file list, you must select it. MS-DOS Shell indicates that a file is selected by highlighting its name in the list.

Within a directory, you can select more than one file at a time. This is called "extending" the selection. For example, you can select several files and copy them to another directory. You can select files that are:

  * In consecutive order

  * Scattered throughout the directory

  * In more than one directory

You can always cancel a selection or all selections.

You can control how MS-DOS Shell displays information about files by using the File Display Options command on the Options menu. When you start MS-DOS Shell, the file list displays all the files in the current directory except hidden and system files. The files are listed alphabetically by name from A to Z. You can do the following:

  * Change the type of file displayed; for example, you
    can display only files that end with .TXT.

  * Display hidden and system files.

  * Sort alphabetically by filename or by extension,
    by date, by size, or by the order the files are
    placed on the disk.

  * Reverse the alphabetical or numerical order that 
    MS-DOS Shell uses to sort by filename and extension 
    or by date.

Program List Overview

The program list provides a convenient way to display and group program items so they're easy to locate and start. The list that MS-DOS Shell displays when you first use the program list is called the "Main" group. The program list also comes with a group called "Disk Utilities" that contains an assortment of program items that run MS-DOS commands.

The menus at the top of the program list window contain commands for working with program items and groups. You can add, delete, organize, and modify groups and programs in the list by using commands on the File menu.

Active Task List Overview

When task swapping is turned on, the Active Task List displays a list of the programs you started. You use the Active Task List to move from one program to another. For example, you can go from your database program to your spreadsheet, and then to your text editor, without having to quit one program and start another.

When you quit a program, it is deleted from the Active Task List.

CAUTION: You should not run 3270 emulator programs with Task Swapper turned on. Using them with Task Swapper may disconnect you from your mainframe and cause data to be lost.

Program Groups and Program Items

A "group" is a name given to a collection of program items. Groups can also contain other program groups.

A "program item" contains startup instructions for a program. It's not the program file.

Groups can be distinguished from program items by either a different icon (to the left of the group name in graphics mode) or by brackets (surrounding the group name in text mode).

You can add groups and program items to and delete them from the program list, as well as change their properties. You can also copy program items to groups.

The program list comes with the following program items organized by group.

MAIN GROUP

How to Start Programs

MS-DOS Shell offers several ways to start a program:

  * From the file list, choose a program file or a file
    associated with it. You can also select the program file
    and, from the File menu, choose Open. When you quit the
    program, you will return to MS-DOS Shell.

  * From the File menu, choose Run. You type the name of
    the program file and any parameters and switches in the
    dialog box, and then press ENTER. When you quit the
    program, you will return to MS-DOS Shell.

  * From the program list, choose a program item. This is
    the easiest way to start programs you use frequently or
    programs in different directories. When you quit the
    program, you will return to MS-DOS Shell.

  * From the Main group, choose Command Prompt. You type the
    name of the program file and any parameters and switches
    on the command line, and then press ENTER. When you quit
    the program, you must type EXIT to return to MS-DOS
    Shell.

If you                             Start it by using

How to Use More than One Program

You can start several programs and move from one to another. For example, you can go from your database program to your spreadsheet, and then to your text editor, without having to quit one program and start another.

When you choose the Enable Task Swapper command, each program you start is added to the Active Task List. You use the Active Task List to move from one program to another.

When you quit a program, it is deleted from the Active Task List.

CAUTION: You should not run 3270 emulator programs with Task Swapper turned on. Using them with Task Swapper may disconnect you from your mainframe and cause data to be lost.

   " Associated Files "~$123~@@

!$123!@
Associated Files

If you have a set of files that you often use with a particular program, you can save time by associating files with the program. Then, when you choose a file, the program starts and automatically loads the file.

For example, you could associate all .TXT files with your text editor. Then, whenever you opened any .TXT file, MS-DOS Shell would automatically start your text editor and load the .TXT file.

You can also associate files without an extension with a program file. Note that every file without an extension will be associated with the selected program file.

When associating multiple extensions, you can type up to 79 characters in the dialog box. However, you can only associate an extension with one program at a time. For example, you can't associate the extension .TXT with two different text editors at the same time.

You can also cancel the association between a file and a program.

There may be times when you need to use an already associated file with a different program. You can use the Run command to do this.

If the disk has already been formatted and needs to be formatted again, Quick Format is much faster than Format.

You can specify the following parameters and switches:

drive: [/V[:label]] [/U] [/B | /S]

/V[:label]  Labels the disk as specified.
/U          Performs an unconditional format.
/B          Allocates space on the formatted disk for system
            files.
/S          Copies system files to the formatted disk.
