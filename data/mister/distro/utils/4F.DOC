AN OVERVIEW OF 4FILES
=====================  4FILES is a multi-purpose file manager which also
includes a full-featured editor for 4DOS & NDOS "file notes" and the
ability to act as a "front-end" for your favorite utilities and applica-
tions programs. A special effort has been made to make the interface clean
and convenient. Command keystrokes are simple, to the point, and easy to
remember.  A very efficient method of directory navigation is provided.  A
built-in configuration routine makes on-the-fly changes of 4FILES'
settings a simple matter, including changes to the "utility ports" (which
are used to call your utilities and other programs), colors, and many
custom setup choices.  International keyboards and character code pages
are fully supported.

The 4FILES screen shows the contents of the current directory with
subdirectories at the top followed by files, each taking a full line. The
list may be sorted any way you like, either on-the-fly or via command line
switches. Except for sorts by file name (the default), the key field for
the current sort is highlighted on-screen.  Any video mode of 80x25 or
higher is supported.

File and subdirectory names are displayed on the left half of the screen,
one per line, with full statistics.  The right half is space for
descriptive file notes.  If you are using 4DOS or NDOS (superior
COMMAND.COM substitutes), a file note will remain associated with its
file during copy, move and rename operations.  4FILES works fine with
COMMAND.COM too, except that your notes will be lost during the above
file operations.  The new 4DOS-4.0 description "extensions" are detected
if present, but no programs are using them yet.

Full file management facilities are provided via simple mnemonic key
commands for single files and marked groups of files.  These include file
copy,  move, rename, and rename; and create, remove, or rename
directory.  There is  also support for ZIP, ARJ, LHA and other types of
file archives.

Any program file or batch file may be executed directly from the 4FILES
screen, and any file or directory name can be quickly dropped into an
editable DOS command line.  Also, "executable extensions" are supported,
allowing you to select a data file and automatically load it into the
appropriate application program, such as a word processor or database.  You
can also drop back to DOS while leaving 4FILES loaded, and your place in
4FILES will be saved.

There is an internal routine for branding this copy (or later copies you
might  obtain from bulletin boards or your vendor) with the serial number
you will be  given when you register.  Branding deactivates the
registration reminder  screen.


AN ASIDE ABOUT 4DOS & NDOS
==========================  4FILES is at its best when 4DOS or NDOS is used
instead of COMMAND.COM; however, 4FILES is only one small reason to select
one of these excellent command interpreters.  The ability they provide to
annotate your files will revolutionize your computer use, and their powers
go far beyond that, providing many time and frustration saving features
which are missing in MSDOS.  I cannot recommend these award winning

                                                                         3.

products highly enough.  4DOS is shareware (NDOS is not), so it will cost
you nothing more than download time or a handling charge to try it.  Since
4DOS is a very long download, the shareware version is available from Hand-
Crafted Software (maker of 4FILES), along with other shareware and public
domain programs mentioned in this manual (see registration form).  Or you
can get 4DOS directly from JP Software at 800-368-8777.

For brevity, all following references to 4DOS refer to NDOS as well.


SHAREWARE NOTICE
================  4FILES is commercial, copyrighted software and is
distributed as shareware.  The shareware is a marketing method allows you
to evaluate a fully functional program before deciding whether you want to
keep it.  If you decide to keep 4FILES, you must purchase it by sending in
the registration form with full payment.  You may not continue use of
4FILES beyond a period of 30-days from date of first use, unless the copy
you are using has been properly registered for your use and your use
complies with the agreement near the end of this manual.

If you decide not to register, a frank critique or trouble report would
be sincerely appreciated, via a collect phone call, E-mail, or a letter.

Your distribution of 4FILES to others is highly encouraged, provided that
the distribution complies with the agreement at the end of this manual.
Permission for commercial distribution may be withdrawn at any time.

QUICK START  Capacity: 799 records per directory.
===========
             Requires: DOS 3.0+ and 46-110K (depending on directory size).

             SYNTAX:   4F [d:][\][subdir] [/+ /8 /L] [/D] [/E /S /C /N /U]

                       Items in brackets are optional.
                       The current directory is loaded by default.

             MANY FEATURES WILL NOT WORK UNTIL 4FILES IS CONFIGURED.
             <ALT-F10> BRINGS UP THE CONFIGURATION SCREEN.

** Installation: Either copy all files into a subdirectory listed in your
PATH or write a 4DOS alias to call 4FILES, preferably specifying the full
pathspec to speed loading.  Either method allows you to start 4FILES by
typing just its name or alias, regardless of which drive or directory you
are logged onto at any time.  Also, you need to create a TEMP environment
variable pointing to RAMdisk or harddisk directory. If you don't
understand, please see the detailed instructions on page 31.

                                                                         4.

** 4FILES may also be installed under Windows, OS/2 or DESQview, and icons
are provided for the first two.  See instructions in the sections below
for these operating systems.


** Symbols in menus and this manual:  "@" means the ALT key, "^" means the
CTRL key, and "$" means the shift key.


** Quitting: Under DOS, <@ESC> quits to the current directory, and <ESC> or
<^ESC> quit to the original (startup) directory.  You may disable plain
<ESC> via the configuration menu, and there are advantages to doing so.
Under Windows, <$ESC> gives a total quit, and <@ESC> and <^ESC> have their
normal Windows functions.


** Configure 4FILES by typing <@F10>.  Screen colors & blinking, "utility
ports" and many program options are on this menu.  Your utilities,
especially a browse utility such as LIST or TV, must be configured here for
some 4FILES features to work, including HELP.  A pathspec for a utility
is unneeded if the utility is in the PATH, but will give best
performance.  The extension MUST be given with the filename.  If the "
utility" is a 4DOS alias, use the .ALS extension.


** Laptop computers:  On the Configuration Options screen, select keyboard
type "3".  This will substitute easier-to-use keys for several important
functions.  The normal keys will not even work on some laptops.  See key
mappings in the next section.


** Replace your Old .CFG File:  The configuration file format was changed
in version 2S.0.  If your .CFG file is from an earlier version, you must
delete it and configure the new version from scratch.


** Switches: /R /E /S /C /N and /U are command line switches for list
sorting (see P.9): respectively, for sorts by Reverse order, Extension,
Size, Chronology, Note characters, and actual DOS order.  Alphabetical
sorting is the default.  /R may be used alone or with any of the other
four.  If you are upgrading, note that the old /D switch is now /R, and /T
is now /C.

/8 is used to force an 80x25 display, in case you want to switch
automatically while loading or in case of an incompatibility with the
video mode  detection.  /+ must be used with HGC, MDA or CGA for over
80x25.

The /L (Lock) switch causes NumLock to be restored to "numeric" when
4FILES exits, and is useful when using 4FILES with CAD and other number
intensive programs.

/M causes file marks from a previous session to used again rather than be
discarded.  Marks are normally retained only for the current session.
This may also be permanently set from the Configuration Options screen.


                                                                          5.

You may setup 4FILES to run with whatever switches you desire by calling it
with a batch file or 4DOS alias.


** Operation: Use the menu line for guidance, and go with the flow!
Mnemonic keys are used for file management functions, and are shown on
the following pages and the help screen.  <TAB> toggles between File & Note
Modes.  Some keys work in both modes, but are shown only on the menu of one
due to line length limits.  Navigate with the <G+> key (Grey-plus), <G->
and <G*> if you have an AT keyboard.  Other keys will need to be used for
PC and laptop keyboards (see below).  If 4FILES is properly configured,
<F1> shows help and <^F1> shows this manual.  For a tour of a few
features see #6 on page 32.  The tour assumes your bootup directory is
the current directory, and that it has a \UTIL subdirectory.


** 4FILES may be fully evaluated under COMMAND.COM, but for proper handling
of file notes during file copy, move, rename and delete, COMSPEC must be
setup to use 4DOS or NDOS as the secondary (if not also the primary)
command interpreter, instead of COMMAND.COM.

NAVIGATION KEYS FOR DRIVES, DIRECTORIES & LISTS
-----------------------------------------------

 One of 4FILES' strengths is its efficient and flexible mapping of
 system  navigation features to the keyboard.  Three keys control
 drive-changes and several ways of changing directories.  One of the keys
 controls three features through a logical progression of single, double
 or triple taps.  Another key has a dual function -- if the highlighted
 record is a  directory it changes to the directory; if the record is a

                                                                         7.

 file or archive, its contents are viewed. The mapping and functions are
 simple and easy to remember -- and the keys are handily close to the
 arrow and page keys.

 The navigation keymapping depends on the type of keyboard you are using.
 4FILES attempts to choose an AT or PC keyboard for you based on a test
 of the keyboard BIOS, but this is not foolproof and may be overridden
 from the Configuration Options screen.  The laptop keyboard cannot be
 automatically detected, and must always be explicitly selected.  Here are
 the active navigation keys:

                 (A)bandon unsaved edits.  This also works in File Mode.

  ^Y          -- DELETE NOTE.
  @^Y         -- Delete tail of note (from cursor to end).

                                                                         9.

  <Sh-Lf>     -- Exit FLR mode (or use <ESC>, <CR> or any bar movements).
  <Sh-BS>     -- Destructive "Fore-space", available in FLR mode only.

  <ESC>       -- Like <^ESC>. Can be disabled with a configuration switch.

  <^ESC> or <@ESC> -- Quit to original or current directory, respectively,
                      DOS only. (If you use NEWKEY, see page 16.)  Under
                      Windows & OS/2 these keys have their normal meanings.

  <Sh-ESC>    -- Terminate 4FILES.  Active in Windows and OS/2 only.


FILE MODE KEYCOMMANDS:
----------------------

  <^E> or
  <^E><^E> -- Presents a DOS command line with or without the current
               file name.  Appending "++" to a command freezes the screen
               temporarily after execution, or freezing can be permanently
               set via the Configuration Options screen.  Executing a
               blank command line shells to a secondary "real" DOS session.

  <^H>      -- Shell to 4DOS & show the selectable command history window.
               KEYSTACK.COM (a 4DOS TSR) must be loaded before 4FILES.

  <^X>      -- Instantly executes records that are .COM, .EXE, .BAT or .BTM
               files; also acts on data files with "executable extensions".

 <F7> or
 <NUM-LK>   -- Toggles between showing file attributes and file time.  The
               works only on non-laptop keyboards; <F7> works on all.


  FOR FILES
  ---------
  A / ^A  -- Change attributes of current file or all marked files.
  C / ^C  -- Copy current file or all marked files.
  D / ^D  -- Delete current file or all marked files.
  M / ^M  -- Move file or all marked files.
  R / ^R  -- Rename current or marked files.  (LCD 4.0B+ & ACD compatible.)
  S       -- Resort the listed files with a new sort type or order.

  FOR DIRECTORIES
  ---------------
  N       -- Create a "New" Directory.  LCD/ACD/NCD compatible.
  K       -- "Kill" (remove) highlighted directory. LCD/ACD/NCD compatible.
  R       -- Rename current directory.  Descriptive note, if any, will be
             lost.  (LCD 4.0B+ and ACD compatible.)
  <G**>   -- Change directory.  (See above for KB=2 or 3 substitutions.)

                                                                        10.
  FILE MARKING
  ------------
  <F5>  / <F6>   --  Mark and Unmark the CURRENT file.
  <^F5> / <^F6>  --  Mark and Unmark ALL files.
  <^/>  / <^\>   --    "   "    "     "    "
  <Space>        --  Toggle mark on CURRENT file.
  <^Space>       --  Toggle marks on ALL files.


====================================
DRIVE & DIRECTORY NAVIGATION DETAILS
====================================

After hitting <G*> (or one of the substitute keys for other keyboards) you
will be prompted to enter a drive letter. A valid entry will cause an
immediate change to the drive.  A second hit on <G*> (instead of typing a
drive letter) presents an input field for specifying a new directory
and/or drive.  <G***> makes an immediate change to the previous directory.

The <G**> command is compatible with LCD, ACD or NCD (directory changing
utilities) if 4FILES has been configured to use one of them, allowing you
to enter fragmentary path names for directory changes.  This REALLY saves
time.  The databases used by these programs are updated by 4FILES when
directories are created, deleted or renamed.

Hitting <G+> while the cursor is on a subdirectory record will cause 4FILES
to change to that subdirectory.  If this is the ".." record, the change
will be to the parent of the current directory.  <G-> is preferable
though, since it will change to the parent directory from ANY record.

When changing to a parent directory, the cursor will quick-scroll from the
top of the listing down to the record of the subdirectory you just left.
This is helpful when inspecting a succession of child directories, since
you always return to your last place in the parent, rather than its first
record.  The scrolling action gives a quick impression of your current
location in the list.


MOUSE NAVIGATION & OTHER USES
=============================  The navigation key commands are mirrored
in the mouse commands.  For three button mice you will see that commands
for navigating the listing are also included.  Navigation functions are
denoted here with AT-keyboard key symbols.


   MOUSE BUTTONS: |  L--    M--    R--     L-R     LM-      -MR      LMR
   ===============|========================================================
   3 Button Mouse | <G+>   <G->   <ESC>   <TAB>   <PgUp>   <PgDn>   <F9>
                  |
   2 Button Mouse | <G+>          <ESC>   <G->

   NOTE: (1) Mouse type is automatically detected.
         (2) OS/2's Presentation Manager disables the middle mouse button!
         (3) See the Mouse Use section for more information.

                                                                         11.
The mouse handler is setup so that no action is taken until all depressed
buttons have been released.  To experiment, for a 'page-down' hold down
the right button -- no rush -- and hit the middle button at your leisure.
Then lift one finger -- again no rush -- and when the second finger is
lifted the action is taken.

To use the mouse when running under MS-Windows, the mouse driver must be
loaded before loading Windows, otherwise the mouse will not function in
Windows DOS sessions.

The handler remains active in called utilities, giving mouse capability
to utilities which have none.  The right-button (<ESC>) will quit the
utility, but the hair-trigger may also terminate 4FILES accidentally.
For this reason, <ESC> may be disabled as a means of terminating 4FILES.


SEEKING A FILE ON THE LIST
==========================  Scrolling to a file in a directory listing is
easy: just hit an <@-char> key, where "char" is the alpha or numeric first
character of the file or directory name.  You will be delivered to the next
occurrence of a record starting with that character.  On AT and laptop
keyboards <SCL-LK> toggles the search direction at any time, including in
mid-search.  On PC keyboards, <Keypad-5> performs this function instead
since <SCL-LK> is used for directory navigation.


FILE MODE & NOTE MODE
=====================  4FILES starts in FILE MODE, with the file management
functions are enabled.  <TAB> toggles between File Mode and Note Mode.  You
will notice that the menu changes with the mode, and you will find that
while every command on each menu will work in its mode, some will also
work in the other mode.  There is not a enough space on the single menu
line to list all commands for each mode, but they are logical and you'll
catch on.

===============
USING FILE MODE
===============

    The file mode commands are mnemonic keys:

    <C>opy, <M>ove, <R>ename, <D>elete, and <A>ttributes for single files.

    <^C>opy, <^M>ove, <^R>ename, <^D>elete, <^A>ttributes and <^Z>ip for
    marked files.

    <N>ew-directory, <K>ill-directory, <R>ename-directory for directories.

    <^E>xecute-field, <^E^E>xecute DOS shell, e<^X>ecute-now, and
    <^H>istory list execution.


File Management
---------------
Copy, move and rename rely directly on 4DOS resources, and keep the file
notes with their files.  The Z and ^Z (Zip) commands are for archiving
files, and support ARJ and LHA archivers as well as PKZIP.  The archiver

                                                                        12.
is selected based on the extension given for the target file, and .ZIP is
the default if none is given.  File notes remain associated with their
files in ZIP archives, and this feature will also be added for ARJ files
as soon as possible.  To unzip the comments 4FILES puts in an archive, you
must port the shareware program 4UNZIP to the <F4> key.  (4FILES will soon
have an internal function to completely replace the need for 4UNZIP, and
will be able to provide the same service for ARJ files.)

History lists are maintained separately for target file names for copy/
move, archive (Z/^Z) and rename commands.  A common target path history
list is maintained for those commands which use it.  The list capacities
are all ten strings.  The input field is initially blank, but pressing the
DownArrow key will display the current filename for editing.  The oldest
filename is next in line.  UpArrow accesses (from blank input fields) the
most recent list addition.

A and ^A are mnemonic commands to change file attributes.  If plain A is
hit, an editable image of the current file's actual attributes is displayed
for modification.  If ^A is hit (operating on marked files), a template
instead of an actual image is shown. In the template, each attribute letter
is initially preceded by a "?" wildcard, indicating that the existing
attribute will be unchanged.  Repeatedly typing an attribute character (R,
A, S or H) toggles the action on that attribute through a cycle of, for
example, ?R, +R, -R, and back to ?R.  + and - indicate the attribute will
be forced "ON" or "OFF" for each file.

Especially with the ^A command it is useful to be able to see the current
attributes for all files at once, but the default is to not display them.
The file creation time field may be toggled between showing time and file
attributes via the <F7> or <Sh-NumLock> key, which are functional in both
File and Note Modes.  <F7> is functional for all keyboards, and the other
key only for non-laptop keyboards.

D deletes the current file, and requires a double-tap of the "Y" key for
confirmation.  The double tap is a safety feature, so that typing
something like "dynamic" in File Mode when you think you are in Note Mode
will not delete the current file.  ^D acts on all marked files, and has a
simple yes/no confirmation.

Note that for the marked file and archiving operations to work as fast as
possible you should have a temporary directory, named TEMP, set up.  In
AUTOEXEC.BAT you can put a statement like:  SET TEMP=d:\ where "d" is a
RAMDISK or hard drive.  A directory may be added if desired.  4FILES
deletes its temporary files when done with them.


File Execution
--------------
^E presents a DOS command line loaded with the name of the current record
name, and the line editor is forced into insert mode.  The cursor controls
are identical to those for the note editor.  ^E^E provides a blank command
line in which you may enter any command; just like the DOS command line.
^Y deletes the command.  A history list with a capacity of ten strings is
maintained for the ^E and ^E^E commands.

                                                                        13.

The typed-in command is executed, and when it finishes the return to 4FILES
is automatic.  In many situations this is desirable, but in some cases (the
DOS SET command is an example) the information you want to see flashes off
the screen.  To prevent this there are two ways to cause 4FILES to delay
clearing the screen until a key is hit.  One is to set the configuration
switch named "Pause after ^E" to Yes (NO is the factory default).  The
other is to append ++ to the ^E command line.  ++ is a 4FILES flag, and is
not actually part of the command.  Either the <G+> or <Shift=> may be used
to generate +.  If the switch is set to YES, a "- -" appendage will force
an immediate return.

If you wish to work directly from the real DOS prompt for a while, type
^E^E <CR>.  Executing the blank command line will load a secondary DOS
shell, and you will remain in the shell until you type EXIT to return to
4FILES (see 4FILES Tip #5, below).  Back in 4FILES, you will be returned
to the same drive:directory you were in before.

The ^X or <F9> command will execute the current file immediately with no
prompting if it is an executable file or is a data file for which you have
set up an executable extension.  This command may be forced to pause after
execution with the "Pause after ^X" configuration switch.  An executable
extension may be set up with a statement such as this in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file:

                       SET DOC=C:\WP\WP.EXE

If you press ^X or <F9> on a file with a .DOC extension, 4FILES will then
load it into Word Perfect for you.


Directory Management
--------------------
<N>ew-directory and <K>ill-directory are commands to make and remove
directories.  <R>ename works both for subdirectories and files.  These
commands update ACD, LCD, and NCD databases, if 4FILES is configured to
use one of these utilities.


MARKING FILES
-------------
There are several ways to mark files.  <F5> & <F6> mark and unmark
records for the above marked file operations.  <SPACE> toggles the mark
of the current file.  <^F5> & <^F6> mark and unmark all records, and <^
SPACE> toggles the marks of all files.  <^/> and <^\> duplicate the <^F5>
and <^F6> keys for Windows compatibility.

A count of marked files and marked bytes is shown on the second line in a
special configurable color.  Marking may be done in both File & Note
Modes.  Marked file operations automatically pass over subdirectories and
hidden files, and marking of DESCRIPT.ION is expressly blocked.  Note
however that UPON EXIT OR DURING THE NEXT DIRECTORY CHANGE, if no file
notes remain, DESCRIPT.ION will be deleted for you automatically.  An
empty DESCRIPT.ION may also be deleted via the "D" single file command.

                                                                        14.

When changing directories or calling a utility, any file marks are saved in
a file named DEMARCAT.ION, kept in the current directory.  When entering or
returning to a directory, if this file is found the marks are restored.
The exception is that if the file was written during a previous 4FILES
session it is instead deleted.  So, within a session all marks remain
until they are unmarked, but they are usually not "sticky" between
sessions.

There are two ways to have "sticky" marks, if you wish.  One is via a
Configuration Menu switch.  The other is the /M command line switch.  The
later is particularly useful to reuse marks on the spur of the moment, if
the menu switch is "off." The marks in the current directory would
otherwise be lost when 4FILES loads, before you have a chance to change
the menu switch.


SORTING THE LIST OF FILES
-------------------------
While the subdirectory portion of the list is always alphabetically
sorted, the files-portion may be sorted in various ways either on-the-fly
or via command line switches.  The default sort is alphabetical, in
ascending order.  To change the sort on-the-fly, type S while in DOS
mode. After making a selection, which may involve making settings for
both type of sort and for ascending or descending order, a second tap on
the last key hit will exit the sort menu and cause the sort to be made.
<CR> will exit also.

    The command line sort switches are described below.  /D may be used by
itself or in combination with other switches, and affects only the primary
sort. The following sorts also apply to on-the-fly setting::

        SWITCH          PRIMARY SORT          SECONDARY SORT
        -------        -----------------     ------------------
        DEFAULT         FILENAME               .EXT
          /E            .EXT                   FILENAME
          /S            File Size              FILENAME.EXT
          /C            Chronological          FILENAME.EXT
          /N            File Note              FILENAME.EXT

          /U            Unsorted, DOS order    --
          /D            Descending Order       Descending Order

/D may be combined with any of the other switches.  Except when sorting by
filename, the primary sort field is highlighted with a color that is set on
the configuration menu.  For (U)nsorted, the filename field is highlighted.
Only files, never subdirectories, are sorted.  International code pages are
used for sorting as appropriate.  The "tips" section has more on sorting.

                                                                        15.
=============
UTILITY PORTS    FILE BROWSING, EDITING, UNZIPPING, DUPLICATES, etc.
=============    ---------------------------------------------------

Some of 4FILES' most useful functions are performed by automatically
executing other programs at the stroke of a key.  "Utility ports" are the
means by which you associate such programs with their various 4FILES
control keys and setup 4FILES to send the command line information
(switches, filenames, etc.) they need to be fed.  These ports appear on
the Configuration Utility Ports screen, and they allow you to easily
customize 4FILES to use your favorite utilities or other programs.

Several programs are recommended below for use in various ports.  If you
don't have these utilities or equivalents, they may be downloaded free on
your first call to my BBS, which is a subsystem of MAS-BBS in New York.
The latest version of 4FILES and a collection of pertinent utilities are
found there in separate directories. See page 1 for log-on instructions.
Also, I can mail you a full set of useful shareware and public domain
utilities (including 4DOS, which is not available on the BBS) -- see the
registration form for details.


BROWSING FILES
--------------
The <G+> key (or its substitute) is overloaded in a sensible way.  Not
only will it allow you to "see" the contents of a subdirectory, if the
highlighted record is a file, it will call up your favorite file browser
or archive viewer with the file loaded.  In File Mode, <CR> may be
configured to duplicate the function of <G+>, although this is not
recommended unless you really need it.

4FILES comes configured with the internal 4DOS LIST command as the browser,
but any browser can be used.  Shelling to DOS to run this internal
command is slow, but by using browse utilities like TV.COM, PC-Magazine'
s free BROWSE.COM or Vern Buerg's LIST.COM, your file will be displayed
in a literal eye-blink.

The <G+> and <^G+> commands recognize archive files if they are
self-extracting (.EXE) files or if they have one of these extensions: .ZIP,
.ARC, .DWC, .LBR, .LZH, .PAK or .ZOO.  When an archive is detected an
archive viewer is called.  There are various types of archive browsers
available.  FV.COM shows a simple listing of the contents.  ZR, LR, AR and
ZOR not only show a listing (of ZIP, LHZ, ARJ and ZOO file respectively),
but can view the text of files inside the archive and extract selected
files from the archive.  These four programs can be found on BBSs as
XRAY.ZIP or XRAY???.ZIP.

    4F-XRAY.BAT was provided with your copy of 4FILES to allow the most
appropriate one of these five browsers to be called automatically via one
4FILES utility port.  If you use this batch file, it is best mapped to
the <G+> key, and it is handy to then have FV mapped independently to the
<G+> key.  4FILES comes with the <G+> mapped to FV and <^G+> mapped to
ZR.COM.

While in browsers and other utilities, the mouse buttons work "as
initialized" by 4FILES, and provides scrolling actions plus a quick return
via the right button.  The combination of <left-button>=<G+> and

                                                                        16.

<right-button>=<ESC>, combined with movement of the 4FILES cursor bar by
the mouse, allows one handed "rapid-fire" inspection of multiple files.
(Note: if you load 4FILES via SHROOM or call a utility with SWAPDOS, the
mouse will be automatically disabled, temporarily.  This is necessary since
the mouse handler gets overwritten.)

In the midst of your rapid firing though, you will sometimes inadvertently
exit from 4FILES (even without the mouse).  To avoid this, you can
reconfigure to disable quitting via the <ESC> key.  The <^ESC> and <@ESC>
keys still function, and allow you to quit to the original or current
directory respectively.  Improper <ESC> use will then display a menu of the
proper keys.  If you use NEWKEY, to enable 4FILES to use the <^ESC> key,
run NEWKEYSP.EXE, pick "I" on the menu, and make an entry for <^ESC>.


EDITING FILES
-------------
<F2> calls your editor, loading it with the filename of the current
record.  As supplied, editor access to .COM .EXE .BIN .OBJ .SYS .LIB .WKS
.DB & .OVL extensions and the seven above archive extensions is denied.
The denied extensions may be reconfigured.  Denials protect the integrity
of non-text files.  A second editor or word processor (or any utility,
such as a .GIF viewer) may be mapped to <^F2>.  The denied extensions
apply to this key as well.  If a disk is write-protected, <F2> will give
an error message.  If you have no editor, pick up PC-Mag's free TED.COM.

Note that an "R" switch is provided in the configuration listing for each
utility port.  It forces reloading the current directory upon return from
the utility, and should be "ON" for any editor or other utility which can
change file size or directory contents.  "W" (wait before redisplaying)
should be off, since you will want to return immediately to 4FILES from an
editor.

To create a NEW file, hit <F2> while on a NON-FILE RECORD.  This will not
work if the "R" switch is off.  You will be prompted for names for the new
files, but may hit <CR> on the blank field blank if you wish.  Some editors
may not be able to utilize more than one filename from the command line.


FINDING DUPLICATE FILES
-----------------------
<F3> is initially set up to call a file finder utility called WHERE.EXE,
loaded with the current file name.  Bruce Gavin's utility FIND.EXE is a
good one to use here.  A utility of any type may be mapped to this key.


UNZIPPING FILES
---------------
<F4> is used to call 4UNZIP, a shareware utility which in turn calls
PKUNZIP.  A list is shown of the files archived in a .ZIP file, and files
can be unzipped singly or in marked groups.  4UNZIP is important here
since it will recover the file notes 4FILES archived with their files.
Note: the current 4UNZIP version causes a crash (immediately or a soon
after use, with or without 4FILES) if certain keyboard buffer-expanders
are used.  Test your setup!

                                                                        17.

4FILES will soon have a built-in routine which will replace 4UNZIP
completely, and which will work on both ARJ and ZIP files (4UNZIP works
only on ZIPs.  Some 4FILES users setup <F4> or <^G+>-Zip to call SHEZ, a
comprehensive archiving tool (it's shareware).


====================
UTILITY PORTS IN USE
====================

One potential difficulty which 4FILES avoids is that some utilities and
editors you might like to call allow you to delete/rename files or change
drives/directories.  When the utility is exited, 4FILES by default
explicitly changes back to its last drive/directory and rereads the
directory list.  The bar is returned to the last record it was on, or if
deleted, to the nearest record number possible.  This process takes a
little longer than assuming that the directory structure is unchanged,
and also destroys the "+/-" note-modified indicators and any file marks,
but is SAFE.

Alternatively, you may tell 4FILES not to reload the directory by setting
the "R" switch for the port to "N".  Use the "N" setting ONLY if you know
the subject utility is not capable of the operations mentioned in the
previous paragraph.

Note that the switch for the browser is also operative when displaying Help
or this manual with <F1> or <^F1>, since the browser is used to display
these files.  Two help files are provided: 4F.HLP and 4F.KEY.  The file
4FILES will call is 4F.HLP, so if you wish to use the other, rename both.


===============
USING NOTE MODE
===============

ANNOTATING FILES
================  4FILES supports file notes (or "descriptions" in 4DOS
parlance) up to 40-characters long, and each directory with annotated files
will contain a hidden file named DESCRIPT.ION, containing the note data for
all files in the directory.

Beginning with release 4.01, 4DOS can handle file notes up to
120-characters long, but 4FILES will not be able to use the extra
capacity until a later release.  For now though, 4FILES does detect notes
of over 40-characters and will warn you of the situation.  To limit
creation of notes by 4DOS or other utilities to 40 characters, be sure
that in your 4DOS.INI file the directive DescriptionMax=040 is set, which
is the default setting.

File copying, moving, or renaming will however always work properly
regardless of description length since 4FILES relies directly on 4DOS
resources for these functions.  The only caveat is, again, that if a note
has been edited, 4FILES will eventually rewrite DESCRIPT.ION, and only the
first 40 characters of each note will be then be written.

                                                                        18.

To put the "*" character in a note, the SHIFT-8 key must be used since <G*>
has a special function.

Great attention has been devoted to making 4FILES a true power tool for
creating or modifying one or a multitude of notes.  These are the features:


CUT & PASTE & NOTE DELETES
==========================  <F9> initiates the text-copying mode.
Highlight the desired text by moving the cursor horizontally, and then hit
<CR> to put it in the paste buffer.  <^F9> cuts  (rather than copying) the
text to the buffer, and <@F9> copies the whole note.

<F10> pastes text in the buffer at the cursor position.  If a PASTE
causes an overflow of the 40-character note space, the note is moved to
an 80-character space at the bottom of the screen.  This expanded field
is fully editable ( see following).  Captured text stays in the buffer
when changing drives or directories.  <F10> is inactive in FLR mode.

^Y deletes the entire line.  In earlier versions it cut the line to the
cut- buffer, but now the buffer is loaded only via the various <F9> keys.

^Y is functional in notes and all text input fields and command lines.

In Note Mode, ^D will delete the notes of all marked files.  As with file
deletion, a double-tap of the "Y" key is required to affirm the deletion.
The message is put on a different part of the screen than for file
deletion, to be sure you realize that you are deleting notes, not files.


EXPANDED EDIT FIELD
===================  Expanded Field Mode is triggered whenever typing or
pasting causes the length of the current note to exceed 40 characters, and
allows editing over a full 80-character field.  The note is moved to a
highlighted 80- character field at the bottom of the screen and the
40-character field is blotted out.  Two "eyebrows" of contrasting "blot"
characters, each 40-characters long, are placed above this field, and act
as a guide for where the over-long note will be truncated when <CR> or
<ESC> is hit. The effect of the blotted out 40- character field, eyebrows,
and highlighted bottom row is to draw your eyes down to the expanded field.

To return to the 40-character field, hit <ESC> or <CR>.  <ESC> will return
to the current record and <CR> moves the cursor to the next record.  In
both cases the note is truncated after the 40th character.  4FILES will
not accept more than 80 characters under any circumstances, and will block
any pasting or typing which would exceed that size.  A 40-character long
cut string can be pasted into a full 40-character note, since the expanded
field will be used for the overflow.


FLUSH RIGHT (FLR) MODE
======================  To create notes which are easy to scan by eye, it
is sometimes useful to make part of a note left justified and part of it
right justified.  Hitting <Sh-Rt-Arrow> provides right justified text in
either of two ways:

                                                                        19.

1. If there is text to the right of the cursor, it is bumped over to the
right margin.  The cursor is not moved, and 4FILES remains in its normal,
left justified editing mode.

2. If there is no text to the right of the cursor, 4FILES enters Flush-
Right Mode (FLR).  The cursor is moved to the right margin, and highlighted
indicators are set-up to show the part of the note field which is available
for FLR text entry.  Text will grow leftward from the cursor, which is
initially outside the field.  Editing is forced into insert mode.  All
horizontal cursor movement keys are active.  ^Left & ^Right behave slightly
different than in normal mode, putting the cursor between words, and
Shft-BS is enabled.  Collision of new FLR text with any left-justified text
is prevented.  Cut and paste are not allowed.


QUITTING FLR MODE
=================  There are three ways to leave FLR mode, with differing
effects on the text cursor and the cursor bar.  In all cases, the
pre-existing insert or overwrite mode will be restored.  The choices:

        <ESC>            Leaves the cursor where it is.
        <Sh-Left>        Sends the cursor home.
        (Record-change)  (All vertical cursor keys act normally.)


INSERT / OVERWRITE MODES
========================  The INSERT mode default may be changed from the
configuration menu.  The active mode may be toggled with <INS>.


==============================
INTERNAL CONFIGURATION ROUTINE
==============================

CUSTOMIZING 4FILES
==================  You can change 4FILES' on-screen appearance, the
INSERT / OVERWRITE default, "utility port" setups, and a number of other
features.  <Alt-F10> displays the Main Configuration Menu, which offers
four Configuration Screen for action and <ESC> to quit.  If you edit the
configuration you will instead be given different quit options: (S)ession
only changes or (P)ermanent changes, which are saved to disk in a .CFG
file.  If you rename 4FILES, 4FILES will detect its new name and will
recognize only a .CFG file of the same name.  On exit from configuration,
new and old data are compared, and you are prompted to save the
configuration only if there is a difference.  When quitting 4FILES, you
will have an opportunity to save session-only configuration changes if you
like them.


"Utility Ports" Configuration Screen
====================================
Each utility port shown has a Key/Function name which indicates the key to
access the utility and the recommended use for the port.  The first field
of each line is the "utility field", and is for an alias name, file name,
(filespecs) or a complete pathspec for a utility or application.  A

                                                                        20.

complete pathspec may speed loading, but is not necessary if the program
is in your PATH.  (DOS must know where to find the program, either from
the pathspec or by searching each directory listed in your system's PATH.)
A complete filespec can dramatically speed loading the utility, and is
recommended.  In all cases, a file extension MUST be given.  Valid
extensions include .BAT, .BTM and .ALS.  ".ALS" must be appended to
aliases or DOS internal commands.  .ALS is a flag for 4FILES, and is not
included in the actual call.  All commands without extensions will fail to
execute.

If you wish to swap 4FILES to EMS or XMS memory or a hard disk before
executing a utility or application, SWAPDOS.COM can be used.  Enter SWAPDOS
in the utility field.  The name of the program to be called then goes in
the tail ("T=") field, preceded by any command line switches for SWAPDOS
and followed by any of its own switches.

Another swap program which can be used for this is SHROOM.  4FILES rather
than the utility is loaded via SHROOM, so SHROOM should not be placed in a
port's configuration.  With SWAPDOS, swapping only occurs for the selected
utilities, while SHROOM will swap for all utilities and when shelling to
DOS.  On the other hand, SHROOM does fast executions via the DOS EXEC
function, while SWAPDOS makes a slower shell to DOS.  On any utility or
DOS calls in which SHROOM or SWAPDOS is active, the 4FILES mouse and
keyboard handlers are necessarily disabled during the call.

Errors in calling .COM and .EXE programs from 4FILES (e.g. file not found)
are shown as "configuration incorrect", but execution errors for batch
files and aliases are not trapped.  If execution is a quick flash on the
screen, you need to repeat the operation with a "screen pause" to see what
is happening. There are two ways to do this; one global and one specific to
the utility.  To pause after execution of all utilities and the DOS shell
(^E commands), set the "Pause after ^E" configuration switch to "Y".  To
cause a particular utility to pause after execution, set its  "H=" (hold
screen) switch to "Y".  There is also a "Pause after ^X" switch.

Displaying Help and this manual with <F1> and <^F1> (respectively) will
work only if the <G+> BROWSE key is configured correctly.

The next field in the utility-port block is the command line tail.  This
sends filenames, command line switches or other parameters to the utility.
"$F" inserts the current filename with extension, and may be placed where
needed among the parameters.  No spaces are needed before or after $F,
saving space. $P causes the full pathspec and filename to be inserted, and
is a good choice if you use Windows.  $N inserts the filename without its
extension.

The "H" field is a YES/NO field which determines whether or not 4FILES
waits for a keyhit after the utility has finished executing.  Set it to "Y"
for utilities which run straight through and exit without any user input.

The "R" field is also a YES/NO field which determines whether 4FILES
reloads the directory list and DESCRIPT.ION file after the utility exits.
It must be set to "Y" if the utility is capable of managing files or
changing drives and directories.  It should for example be "Y" for an
editor or word processor.

                                                                        21.
"Configuration Options" Screen
==============================
This screen provides switches, grouped into sections, for the following:


KEYBOARD/MOUSE SWITCHES:
------------------------
Keyboard Code  -- Two letter DOS keyboard-country-code.  LEAVE THIS BLANK
                  UNLESS YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.  Takes effect next session.

Keyboard Type  -- "1" = AT keyboard, <G*>, <G->, <G+> keys active.
                  "2" = PC keyboard, substitutes <Scl-Lock> for <G*>.
                  "3" = Laptop.  Substitutes <[>, <]>, and <ENTER> for above
                        and <F7> to toggle file-time/file-attributes display.

Overtype Default -- The INSERT mode default can be changed to OVERTYPE.

Disable <ESC>  -- To avoid inadvertent exits via <ESC> set this to "Y"
                  and exit with <^ESC> or <@ESC>.  If you use NEWKEY, see
                  P.10. In MS-Windows and OS/2 setting this switch allows
                  task switching to occur.

<CR> for <G+>  -- "Y" substitutes the <Enter> (<CR>) key for the <G+> key,
                  in File Mode only.  <CR> retains its text writing
                  meaning in Note Mode.

Enable Mouse   -- "N" leaves the mouse set up as-received by 4FILES.  "Y"
                  causes 4FILES to install its own mouse handler.


VIDEO SWITCHES:
---------------
Retain Colors  -- "Y" leaves the screen set to the 4FILES text color at
                   exit; otherwise the DOS color is restored.

Enable Blinking-- 4FILES disables blinking to allow all color choices.
                  To restore blinking on exit and during utility calls,
                  set this to "Y"; otherwise blinking is left off.

Snow Prevention - Set to "Y" if your CGA monitor has a snow problem.


SOUND:
------
Beep OK?       -- The beep is on by default, and may be turned off.


SHELLING OPTIONS:
-----------------
Use Copy/Move Alias? -- "N" is the default.  Use __CAUTION__ if you change
                  this.  "Y" disables 4FILES' protection against trashing
                  a file if you specify a non-existent directory during
                  a marked files copy/move.  If set to "Y" your aliases
                  for both Copy and Move must provide this protection.

                                                                        22.

Full Screen Copy -- For best appearance, set this to "Y" and see if your
                  video system will work properly with the smaller window
                  provided.  4FILES sets up the window and DOS then runs
                  within it.  "Y" works for most systems.

Full Screen Archiving -- Similar to the above, providing separate control
                  for windowing of file archiving operations.

Pause After ^E -- If the result of an (^E)xecute flashes off screen, set
                   this to "Y", or alternatively enter "++" at the end of
                   the ^E command input line.  Both await a keyhit.

Pause After ^X -- This prevents the result of an immediate execution from
                  flashing off screen, as above.


OTHER OPTION SWITCHES:
----------------------
Keep File Marks? -- File marks from previous sessions are normally
                  disregarded.  This configuration switch or the /M
                  command line switch may be used to utilize old marks.

Show File Attributes -- Normally 4FILES starts up with the file time shown
                  field displayed.  This switch causes file attributes to
                  be shown instead.  (<F7> toggles the display during a
                  4FILES session.)


Further note on the "Use Copy/Move Alias?" Switch
-------------------------------------------------
Use of this switch is not recommended, but is provided for power
users.  It should normally be set to "N".  It determines whether an
existing 4DOS command or user alias named COPY, MOVE or RENAME will be
unaliased before sending the command.  NOTE THAT ENABLING ALIASES DISABLES
THE SAFETY IN 4FILES WHICH PREVENTS MARKED FILES FROM OVERWRITING ONE
ANOTHER IF THE TARGET DIRECTORY DOES NOT EXIST.  You MUST incorporate this
safety yourself into BOTH the copy and move aliases you use, for example
by including the 4DOS /D switch.  The 4FILES switch is provided to
support users who have aliases which complete a path fragment (given for a
copy/move operation) into a full path.  If 4FILES were totally safe for
both switch settings, such aliases would be pre-empted by the prompt to
create the non-existent target directory, which is what a path fragment
appears to be.  The switch is completely safe if set to "N."  If set to
"Y," you must take the above precautions.  Also, if set to "Y" your
aliases must be able to handle (either using or discarding) both the /R
and /P switches.


"Configure Colors & Highlights" Screen
======================================

The screen itself does not truly portray the 4FILES colors (so that the
location of input fields can be clearly shown), so a sample screen is
shown at the bottom of the screen.  Just follow the instructions on the
screen.  Since 4FILES turns screen blinking off, monochrome highlights

                                                                        23.

and background colors not normally available (i.e. dark grey) may be
used.  If dark grey is used, you will probably want to set the "Enable
Blinking" switch to "N."

Some color combinations may not work with some "ported utilities".  For
example, if a utility automatically sets up a black on white cursor bar
without clearing the screen to white on black text first, AND if you have
4FILES text set to black on white, you won't see the cursor bar.   This
occurs with 4UNZIP & VDE.COM.  The only solution is to pick text colors for
4FILES which avoid the conflict.  Please write to authors of such programs
and request a "smarter" set up of screen attributes in the next version.
Please notify me as well, and I will contact them too.


================
DISPLAY FEATURES
================

4FILES works with any video text mode of 80x25 or higher. Except for HGC,
MDA and CGA video cards, if a higher mode is used it will be automatically
implemented.  For HGC, MDA and CGA running higher modes (such as with
UltraVision), the /+ command line switch must be used. The reason is that
not all cards in this class are 100% BIOS compatible, in some cases
defeating the automatic detection, and this arrangement assures that all
systems will run " out of the box" in 80x25 mode.  When calling 4FILES
from an application running a higher mode, 80x25 mode may be forced with
the /8 switch.  When calling utilities or shelling, the screen may look
its best (depending on your color choice) if ANSI.SYS is not loaded.

If a CGA video card is detected, a no-snow video writing method is used by
default.  For faster displays, this method may be configured "off".

"T" and "E" indicators near the top and bottom of the screen indicate that
the top or end of the listing is shown on screen.  Used disk bytes are
shown in File Mode, and the 4FILES version number is shown in Note Mode.  A
file count is displayed at all times.  An "S" indicator with an up arrow
symbol on the top row means the file search direction is upward; if there
is no symbol shown the direction is downward.  "PROTECTED" and "ROOT FULL"
messages indicate that the full range of file management and note editing
features are not available for the current disk.  "Protected" means the
disk is write protected.

Records with altered notes are flagged with a "+/-" character at mid-line.
A different character is shown for unaltered notes.  A "delta" character
next to a filename means the file is marked for group file management.


===================================
OPERATING WITH SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTS
===================================

RUNNING UNDER MS-WINDOWS
========================  4FILES runs well as a non-Windows application.
Windows is detected automatically, and regardless of the 4FILES
configuration setting for the ESC key, the CTRL-ESC and ALT-ESC keys will

                                                                        24.

serve their Windows functions.  In Windows, <ESC> or <Shift-ESC> are used
to terminate 4FILES.

Note that the mouse will work in 4FILES only when 4FILES is in a full
screen window -- when the program is in a window, the Windows mouse
handler is operative.  As you should know, you may toggle between windowed
and full screen with the Windows <Alt><Enter> key.  The 4F.PIF file
provided will cause 4FILES to startup in a window, but you may change this
behavior.

This is the recommended way to install 4FILES in Windows:

1) It is best to have two 4FILES installations; one in the Startup Group
which will always be loaded automatically into a minimized-icon or window
whenever you load Windows, and one in whichever Group is normally
showing on your desktop.  This will give one example of how to do this.
Your DOS installation of 4FILES should be completed before proceeding.
Be sure 4F-I-WIN.ICO and 4F-P-WIN.PIF are in the same directory as the
program, or alternately put copies of them in your Windows directory.

2)  Open the Startup Group.  From the Program Manager menu line select
"File," then "New" and "OK" with "Program Item" selected.  You are now in
the Program Properties dialog box.  Type in 4FILES as the description,
then <TAB> to the next field and use the mouse to select the "Browse"
button.  Use the directory tree to find your way to the copy of 4FILES
installed for DOS, and select 4F.COM.

3)  The selection takes you back to Program Properties.  <TAB> to the
Working Directory field and type in the drive and directory you want
4FILES to list when it starts up.  <TAB> to the next field and type the
hot-key combination you wish to use to reopen the 4FILES window.  Finally,
if you do not wish 4FILES to load immediately (remember, this is the
Startup Group) and prefer to have it appear instead as an icon at the
bottom of the screen, set the "Run Minimized" box.  Open the dialog box
menu (upper left corner button), save your setup and then exit.

4)  Now open the Windows PIF Editor.  Open its menu, and cascade through
the "File" and "Open" choices.  Use the tree to find the directory with the
copy of 4FILES that you are installing, and select 4F-WIN.PIF.  You are
returned to the previous dialog box, and the fields have been filled from
the .PIF file.  The "Startup Directory" field here will be over-ridden by
the "Working Directory" entry you made earlier from Program Properties.
Make the Display Usage choice to determine whether 4FILES will start up
full-screen (with 4FILES mouse operational) or in a window (with mouse
Windows mouse operational).  Remember, you can toggle between the display
types and type of mouse operation with <Alt><Enter> at any time.  Save
your work, and exit from PIF Editor.

If you ever create your own .PIF, set the KB Required to 128K.  Although
4FILES is a .COM file, it needs memory for 64K of data in addition to its
own code and buffers, which is also approaching 64K.  Set KB_Desired to
640K, to leave room for utilities called from 4FILES.

                                                                        25.

5)  It is recommended that you do a duplicate installation in the Windows
Group you will normally have showing on your desktop.  This way, if you
terminate 4FILES you will have another icon at hand for loading again
without the bother of opening the Startup Group to find it.

Using 4FILES in Windows
-----------------------
For regular 4FILES use (except during evaluation under COMMAND.COM) be sure
your COMSPEC environment variable specifies 4DOS or NDOS.  To use the mouse
in 4FILES, your mouse driver MUST be loaded prior to loading Windows.
Although Windows does not need a pre-loaded driver, 4FILES does.  The
mouse will have its 4FILES functions when 4FILES is running full screen,
and will have its Windows functions when 4FILES is in a window.  You may
toggle 4FILES between full screen and window displays with <Alt><Enter>.

<Alt><ESC> will swap out of 4FILES to other tasks.  When the swap cycle
comes back to 4FILES, if 4FILES is running full screen, you will come
back to the 4FILES icon and will have to reopen it.  If it is running in
a window though, you will come back to your place on the 4FILES screen, or
the screen of a utility you may have called from 4FILES and been in when
you swapped tasks.  4F-WIN.PIF sets the Windows short-cut to Alt+CAPSLOCK;
this may be changed on the PIF-Editor "Advanced" screen.

One handy use of 4FILES is to have it in a background window that has an
edge or corner showing.  Suppose you are in a Windows application, for
example PageMaker, and you are looking at a directory list, trying to
decide which file to load.  The Windows directory display does not show
file notes or allow you to view a file, and it can be hard to figure out
which file you want.  Just click on the 4FILES window to bring it to the
foreground, change to the same directory, and read your notes.  Then click
on the window for your application, and you are ready to go.  Of course,
with the 4FILES window handy in the background it is also easy to update
your file notes after creating or editing a file with another application.


RUNNING UNDER OS/2
==================  Users report that 4FILES runs well in an OS/2 2.0 VDM.
The author does not yet have OS/2, and has not fine-tuned 4FILES for oper-
ation under it, other than using Alt-ESC & Ctrl-ESC as above.  Suggestions
for use under OS/2 are welcome.  An OS/2 icon is provided.  In Presentation
Manager, OS/2 converts 3-button mice to 2-button action, unfortunately.


RUNNING UNDER DESQVIEW
======================  4FILES is now DESQview (DV) aware, and may be
used in  small or full windows.  Note that even though 4FILES is fully
DV-aware, " Writes directly to screen" must be set to "yes" since
utilities you call from 4FILES may not be DV-aware.  DV's Transfer and
Learn functions are fully functional, even though 4FILES does employ its
own keyboard handler. 4FILES' time slice will be released while 4FILES
is idling.

                                                                        26.

Sufficient memory must be allotted to 4FILES for itself plus the largest
utility (or the DOS secondary shell) which will be called from within it.
You may wish to have "Open" menu entries for a few copies of 4FILES, each
with a different name and its own .CFG file.  For example, one copy might
be setup to call TED (a small freeware text editor) as the editor so 4FILES
can be fully functional with minimal memory requirements; and another copy
might call Multi-Edit (a full featured editor) and be set up for 350+K of
memory.  Due to 4FILES' small size it is realistic to use multiple copies
(each with its own .CFG file) to provide this flexibility.

When setting up for 4FILES it is suggested that the filename plus extension
be used, causing DV to load 4FILES directly itself rather than calling DOS
to load it.  This  saves  several K of memory and saves  much time during
utility calls since execution will be  direct.  On utility calls if  DOS
loaded 4FILES, DV will shell to DOS before the  utility is loaded.  Also,
if a utility is called while 4FILES is in a small window, the utility's
screen may appear to be blank and unscrollable, depending on the location
of text on the page.  In this situation just zoom the window to full size.

In the DV setup for 4FILES, set "Uses it's own colors" to yes, but don't
use colors which interfere with blinking.  For  example, when dark grey is
used for the 4FILES list background, 4FILES  will  display correctly but
when you switch to another window the whole 4FILES window will blink.  Some
monochrome highlight choices have this same effect.

Under DESQview the 4FILES CTRL-ESC and ALT-ESC keys loose their meaning
since 4FILES will always load showing its home directory.  These keys can
still be useful though, allowing "plain" ESC to be deactivated as
described herein.


===============
SAFETY FEATURES
===============

DISK OVERFLOW PREVENTION
========================  In DOS, a file write that exceeds disk capacity
truncates the file, usually with no immediate outward indication of a
problem.  Automatic protection against such data loss must be provided by
the  program itself, and 4FILES is so equipped.  Competing programs do not
check for disk overflow; some simply truncate the file, and some truncate
it to zero length.  Some give absolutely no warning, and others warn only
after the damage is done.

Whenever you change records or directories, 4FILES checks for an over-flow
condition.  If your edits exceed disk capacity, you are immediately alerted
with a message giving the number of excess bytes.  At this point the note
file is still in memory, and operations which would cause a file write
are blocked.  These include drive or directory changes, calling browse or
edit utilities, and quitting.  Meanwhile, you have FULL editing freedom,
even text insertion and pasting, while editing your notes down.

The overflow bytes message is updated on each record change, and the byte
tally can run up as high as necessary.  When the message stops appearing,
the notes will then fit on disk and blocked-off functions are re-enabled.

                                                                        27.

Entirely deleting a note deducts more than the note size from the overflow;
the length of the "filename.ext" plus three delimiter bytes are also
nixed.  If you delete a file (as opposed to just its note) or subdirectory
with the D or K commands, the space freed up from the record and its note
will be properly accounted for.  Changes during ^E operations are
accounted for also since the directory is always reread afterward.

4FILES pinpoints available disk space down to the last byte.  In one
unusual circumstance the overflow detection behavior may seem strange,
although it is still working correctly.  Writing a  new file requires at
least one cluster of disk space (1024, 2048, or 4096 bytes, depending on
the drive). Writing the first note in a subdirectory requires one cluster
of available space, but if the disk is already full, doing so will cause an
overflow condition.  You might try going to another subdirectory that has
notes and deleting a few notes, but this probably will not work.  You may
appear to free up enough bytes, but unless this also frees up a cluster
4FILES will still indicate an overflow since one does in fact exist.

Unmarking files may also reduce disk requirements, especially if all files
are unmarked, freeing up a whole cluster.


READ ONLY "TRAP" AVOIDED
========================  4DOS and 4FILES can move and edit notes only if
the "attribute" of the DESCRIPT.ION file allows a file write.
Unfortunately, the "READ-ONLY" attribute can be inadvertently set by some
utilities, especially those which can operate on blocks of files (such as
XTREE Pro).  When loading a directory, 4FILES checks ahead for the
READ-ONLY attribute, and will prompt you to clear it.  Competing programs
aren't so nice.  They let you edit notes and appear to save your notes to
disk -- but ... uh, uh, surprise!  Your work is gone.  4FILES won't let
you waste effort making edits which can't be saved, nor will it lose them
under any circumstances.

If you say "NO" to clearing the attribute during a directory change, you
return to the old directory.  During 4FILES startup, picking "NO"
terminates the program. "YES" clears the bit, and operations are normal.
NEVER intentionally mark a DESCRIPT.ION file "READ-ONLY" for any reason.
4FILES catches the error, but 4DOS  doesn't check for it.  As a result, a
file moved or copied TO the affected  directory will lose its note.  A
file in that directory will lose its note if it is renamed.

4FILES also will not allow you to use the A or ^A commands to change the
attributes of DESCRIPT.ION, nor will it allow you to copy or rename it.  It
may be deleted only if all notes have been erased.  Such protections are
essential to the safety of the description system.


TIMELY INACCESSIBLE-DISK DETECTION
==================================  Files on a write protected disk
cannot be altered, and if the root directory is full, files can't be
added to it. During 4FILES startup and all drive or directory changes an
immediate check is made to see if one of those conditions exists.  If so,
you will be alerted with a prominent "PROTECTED" or "ROOT FULL" message.
As appropriate, certain 4FILES functions are disabled, and you will get

                                                                        28.

an error message if you try to use them.  For example, in a full root you
will not be able to edit notes unless the DESCRIPT.ION file already
exists.  You can view files on a protected disk, but file management and
note editing is impossible. No wasted time writing notes you can't save!!


INTERNAL CRITICAL ERROR HANDLER
===============================  DOS handles some simple, common problems
as critical errors, and can disrupt execution of a program.  These problems
include leaving a drive door open or calling a drive with no disk inserted.
4FILES has its own INT24 handler to treat such problems seamlessly.  It
also goes to extra effort to handle use of drives A and B in single floppy
systems seamlessly.


===========
4FILES TIPS
===========

Here are some ideas for making the most of 4FILES in everyday use.

1) TEAMWORK WITH LARGE APPLICATIONS #1:  4FILES is a real time saver when
used in conjunction with some application programs.  For example, you can
write a 4DOS alias which loads 4FILES whenever you exit your comm program.
Using Procom as an example, if you create this 4DOS/NDOS alias:

       ALIAS COM = C:\COM\PROCOM ^ 4FILES C:\COM\DOWN /T/D

the command "COM" will cause 4FILES to be load when Procom exits.  Your
download directory will be shown sorted in reverse order by file creation
time, placing new files at the top.  Alternatively, using /E/D would put
.ZIPS at the top.  Then, using <G+> you may view the contents of the new
text or .ZIP files.  To unzip a file, type F4 to call PKUNZIP or 4UNZIP.


2) TEAMWORK WITH LARGE APPLICATIONS #2:  In Windows or OS/2, keep a corner
of the 4FILES window visible in the background where it is immediately
accessible.  Use 4FILES to refer to your file notes when you are having
trouble deciding which file to load into a Windows application from the
"sparse" directory lists Windows provides.  This also keeps 4FILES handy
for quick file note updates when you created or modify data files.


3) MORE ROOM FOR BIG APPLICATIONS:  To make more room for big applications,
you can use SHROOM or SWAPDOS to swap 4FILES to EMS or XMS memory or disk.
Use of these programs is described elsewhere in this manual.  The freed-up
memory may make the difference between your application running or not
running.


4) MULTIPLE 4FILES CONFIGURATIONS: You can write a variety of aliases to
quickly load 4FILES in specialized, frequently used configurations.  An
alias called 4E might call 4FILES with the /E switch set.  Another called

                                                                        29.

4T, might make the call 4FILES C:\WP\TEXT.  In such aliases, giving the
full pathspec to 4FILES will speed loading, or you may want to have the
directory containing 4FILES listed early in your PATH statement.


5) SPEED YOUR RETURN AFTER SHELLING TO DOS: use this alias: ALIAS = E EXIT.
Then "E <CR>" gets you back to 4FILES (or other shelling program) fast from
the secondary shell.


6) REMEMBER THE "DOUBLE-TAP" KEYS:   ^E^E, < G**>, and the double strokes
to quit the Sort menu.  Also <G***> to return to the previous directory.


7) FREEZING THE SCREEN #1: With the ^E command or when using a utility
port with a batch file or alias, a message might flash off screen too fast
to read, or it might appear that nothing happens at all.  Appending a "++"
to the command will freeze the screen after execution until a key is hit,
allowing you to see what happened.  Also, 4FILES can be configured to pause
after every execution.


8) FREEZING THE SCREEN #2: Some utilities you may like to use will scroll
several pages right off the screen.  The solution is to call an alias, as
in these examples calling Borland's TDUMP.  They are most conveniently
placed in an alias file, but can be entered on the command line if the
alias expansion is enclosed in single quotes (once entered they are in
memory, ready for use).  "=" is not needed from the command line.

        ALIAS HEX=C:\PROG\TDUMP.EXE %1-h | MORE
    or  ALIAS HEX=C:\PROG\TDUMP.EXE %1-h | C:\UTIL\LIST.COM /S

    The first example pipes to an MSDOS resource which pauses at the end of
each page.  The later pipes output into Vern Buerg's LIST program, which
allows back and forth scrolling through the output.  To put this to heavy
use, map "HEX.ALS" to the 4FILES F3 key.  (This is just an example; it is
really more efficient to use LIST.COM's ability to do a hex dump directly
by configuring <G+> or <F3> to call it with $F/h in the command tail.)


9) OPTIMUM KEYBOARD: We all get set in our ways so it may take some
adjustment, but if your function keys are across the top, getting a
keyboard with F-keys on the left will REALLY speed up your work in all
programs and make it more accurate.  In 4FILES the proximity of these keys
to <ESC>, <TAB>, <CTRL> and <ALT> is handy, especially when marking/
unmarking all files with ^F5 and ^F6. My switch to such a keyboard was VERY
rewarding!

    If you have a laptop computer, be sure to select KeyboardType=3 from
the Configuration Options screen.  Also, check out the separate cursor
keypad units described above under "Directory Navigation".

                                                                        30.

10) FAST LOADING OF CALLED UTILITIES:  On the configuration screen,
provide the full pathspec and filename for each utility, rather than
relying on DOS to search for the program in your PATH.  Your utilities
will load in the blink of an eye; relying on PATH you will probably notice
at least some delay, and perhaps a lot if the directory holding the
program is deep in your PATH.


11) COLOR SUGGESTION FOR COLOR MONITORS:  As supplied 4FILES displays
in colors that won't interfere with screen blinking.  Through experiment-
ation I have come up with two other color schemes which I feel are easier
on the eyes, as well as being functional.  In particular, they give a good
balance between the color of the cursor bar and the colors of both normal
text and sorted fields.  The best one uses a dark grey background, which
may require switch adjustments on the 4FILES configuration menu if you
have blinking troubles with utilities which are called from 4FILES (the
same attribute bit can mean "dark grey" or "blinking character" depending
on whether the blink-enable bit is turned on or off in the BIOS -- and
some programs fail to set this bit to the state they need to have it in).

                           COLOR SET #1               COLOR SET #2
                    -------------------------    -----------------------
    FIELD         || BACKGROUND   CHARACTER   || BACKGROUND   CHARACTER
    ------------- || ----------   ----------- || ----------   ----------
    NORMAL TEXT   || Dark  Grey   Dark Green  || Black        Dark Cyan
    SORTED FIELD  || Dark  Grey   Light Yell  || Black        Light Yell
    CURSOR BAR    || Light Grey   Black       || Light Grey   Black
    CUT HI-LIGHT  || Dark  Red    Black       || Dark  Grey   Light Red
    FUNCTION KEY  || Dark  Grey   Light Grey  || Light Grey   Black
    MENU TEXT     || Dark  Grey   Dark  Cyan  || Black        Rust
    INDICATORS    || Dark  Red    Light White || Dark  Red    Light Grey


====================================
4FILES ... ORIGIN & FUTURE EVOLUTION
====================================

4FILES is coded entirely in assembly language for high speed and small
size; consequently the work involved has been considerable, and the
job isn't even done.  The code was written entirely in-house and totals
750K, about 23,000 lines of code.

The concept arose from the lack in 4DOS of two things.  1)  4DOS has no
good means to create or edit the file notes it otherwise handles so well,
and its internal note editor is basic and frustrating to use.  2) while
4DOS has its own internal transfer commands (COPY, MOVE and RENAME) which
automatically keep notes with their files, it does not have a good way to
perform these operations on marked groups of files.  4DOS unaware
utilities capable of marked file operations (such as XTREE-PRO) are
however also unsatisfactory, since they are oblivious to file notes and
will trash them.  4FILES was designed as a tool to do all of these things
and more, such as zipping file notes into the archive with their files.

                                                                        31.

In addition, every file manager I tried left much to be desired in terms
of efficiency from the user's viewpoint.  A simple interface packing a lot
of power has been my goal.

The 4FILES project is not yet complete.  Future releases will have an
internal ability to unzip and view archived files, 120-character file
description ability, a dual-directory workspace for file management, and a
built-in ability to swap to EMS or XMS memory when calling utilities or
shelling to DOS.  Your requests for additional features or changes to
existing ones are very welcome!

===========================================
DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING 4FILES
===========================================  For simple instructions see
Quick Start on page 3.  The following assumes you do not have a text editor,
and it will take but a few  minutes.  "< >" means a keyboard key.

1)  The PATH is an internal list of specified drives and subdirectories where
DOS will look for a program you are trying to execute, if it cannot be
found on the current drive and directory.  To see if you have a PATH set
up, type PATH<enter> on the DOS command line.  If the message given is "No
PATH", go to step 2.  Otherwise, write down  one of the paths (there is a
";" separating each) if one which is listed is where you wish to store
4FILES; then go to step 4.  If you didn't write one down, go to step 3.

2. Change to your "boot" drive and directory by typing C: (or A: if you
booted from a floppy) and typing <Enter>.  Then type CD \<Enter> to get to
the "root" directory.  Type DIR<Enter> and look to see if you have the file
AUTOEXEC.BAT. If so, go to step 3.

We will create an AUTOEXEC.BAT file now.  It will be called everytime you
boot your computer, setting your PATH and making a nicer DOS prompt.  Type:
COPY CON AUTOEXEC.BAT <Enter>.  Then, substituting your drive for "d",
type: PATH=d:\UTIL<Enter>PROMPT=$P$G<Enter><Ctrl-Z><Enter>.  Go to step 4.

3.  Add a PATH statement to your existing AUTOEXEC.BAT file by typing:
COPY AUTOEXEC.BAT + CON AUTOEXEC.BAT<Enter>.  What you type on the
"CONsole" is now appended to the file.  Type:

              PATH=d:\UTIL<Enter><Ctrl-Z><Enter>

where " d" is the letter of your boot drive and <Ctrl-Z> is a two key
combination.

4.  Put the 4FILES disk in drive A: and type: COPY A:*.* \UTIL<Enter> to
copy all 4FILES files to the directory.  (Substitute a different directory

                                                                        32.

for \UTIL as necessary, such as one you wrote down in step 1.).  This also
copies all files, including the TV public domain file viewing utility
supplied with 4FILES.

5.  4FILES is now installed.  Since 4FILES is in your PATH now, typing 4F
will start it up no matter what drive or directory you are currently in.

6.  Type: CD \, then start 4FILES by typing 4F.  Next hit the <Alt-F10>
key and "U". The bar will be on the line for the <G+> key (the "grey-plus"
key).  It is set to LIST.ALS (if there is no .CFG file) to allow file
viewing if you have 4DOS installed.  We'll change it; type-in
d:\UTIL\TV.COM (if TV.COM was included with your copy of 4FILES), and type
<ESC> and P.  Move the highlight bar to any file, press <G+>, and TV will
display the file and let you browse it.  Program files will look like
garbage.  <ESC> quits back to 4FILES.

Move the bar to the UTIL directory  and then press <G+>.  You are now in
that directory  (if this fails, use <Scroll-Lock>).  Move down to the
4F-READ.ME file and hit <G+> to browse it.  When done, hit <TAB> and
type (or modify) a file note. Then hit <G-> to return to the parent
directory.  Move elsewhere in that list and hit <G*> 3 times.  You're
back to the previous directory.  Quit with <ESC> or <Alt-ESC>.  More in
the manual.  See the Windows section for further Windows setups.
