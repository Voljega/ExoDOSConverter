    Make WBAT batches 4DOS compatible
    ---------------------------------

1.  4DOS has an unexpected behaviour when parentheses are used in
    the arguments of a CALL statement. A special 4DOS token in the
    file W.BAT will fix this problem:

    Please change (the first line of) the file W.BAT to: WBAT $W %&
                                               -----     ----------

2.  If WBAT is supposed to run under 4DOS as well as MS-DOS, modify
    W.BAT as follows:

    @if "%@eval[2+2]%" == "4" WBAT $W %&
    @if not "%@eval[2+2]%" == "4" WBAT $W %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

    Note: These two lines will remain untouched, because WBAT will start
    writing the SET instructions in the first line that does not begin
    with an @-sign.


3.  Remember known 4DOS issues: %+ and %=

    Avoid a plus sign immediately following a variable, like: %pos%+1,
    because "%+" seems to have higer priority under 4DOS.
    Solution: insert blank space, e.g. %pos% +1 (MS-DOS compatible),
    or ommit the second %-sign.

    The same applies to "%=", e.g. SET %name%=something. Solution ??
