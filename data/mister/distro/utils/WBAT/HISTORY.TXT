    WBAT Version History
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

ver 2.50 - 17 Sep, 2005

    Mouse Reset optional (may be required for devices like touch screen..)
    INI file item: MouseReset (0|1, default 0:no)

ver 2.46 - 23 Aug, 2005

    Internal modification for more OS flexibility:
    W.BAT is opened allowing other tasks to read and write


ver 2.45 - 14 May, 2005  (no public release)

    Bugfix Wbat LIST: if no items in list, the SET WBAT statement
    was corrupted.
    Now an empty list will NOT be displayed at all, and WBAT exits
    as if ESC was pressed.

ver 2.44 - 29 Apr, 2005

    Input field, bug fix: options (U,P) are also accepted if lower case.

    Password mode: If the variable is not empty, the input string is
    replaced with asterisks ("*"), so they will show in the input field.
    (Up to version 2.43 the input field was cleared before editing).
    Note that in case of NO INPUT (i.e. the user leaves the asterisks
    untouched) the asterisks will be returned in the input variable.

ver 2.43 - 01 Sep, 2004

    New command WBAT EL n
    Set errorlevel - can be used to test if WBAT.COM exists

ver 2.42 - 12 Jul, 2004

    New time-out functionality:
    If the pre-selected button is invalid (zero or beyond last item),
    the ESC key will be triggered instead of ENTER.
    This also works with WBAT LIST.

ver 2.41 - 29 Dec, 2003

    Symbol for highlighting text (default: "~") can be changed in
    INI file, [general] section, e.g.: HiSymbol="@"
    This makes it easier to display the short version of filenames.

    Wbat Save/Restore: %temp% directory now works if root (e.g. A:\)

ver 2.40 - 06 Jun, 2003

    Bugfix: Colon marking end of LIST was not handled properly with hotkeys

ver 2.39 - 13 May, 2003

    Wbat LIST, line select by keyboard input: leading spaces ignored

ver 2.38 - 11 Apr, 2003

    Wbat LIST: line select by keyboard input, like in Windows Explorer.

ver 2.37 - 22 Mar, 2003

    Wbat LIST: lines are truncated if too long; no more error msg.
    The WBAT variable will be set to the full length.

    Timer countdown display at position in box marked by "#?" token.
    See Layouts / Timer Display

ver 2.31 - 05 May 2001

    New option "!" in input field layout: input required.
    Box cannot be closed (other than by ESC) when field is empty or blank.
    (cursor jumps to this field, sound).

    All INI file items (not only colors) can be temporarily overridden
    through variables (item name with prefix "W"). See Demo/Setup/INI

    New option in WBAT.INI:
    ESCinput=1 does not discard input on ESC
               (by default input variables remain unchanged)
